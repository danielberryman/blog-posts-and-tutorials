(react) If you don't want to call useState on individual properties what can you do instead? |Use 1 object to manage all component state (individual states in more common in the real world)
(react) What's the best way to do state updates when using a single object? |Use setter and pass in an arrow function where the param is the state variable representing the current state object. In the fn body return an object that includes the rest of the object using the spread operator and then the state you're updating (property: value)
(react) Say you have a state object userInput and a setter setUserInput. Update the title property to have the value 'Hello' in such a way that ensures you're using the most up to date state when making the update. |"setUserInput((userInput) => { return { ...userInput, title: 'Hello' } })"
