## Step 1: Search engines have to be able to find and read your pages
- Search engines have 3 primary functions
  - Crawling
    - Bots go out to find content
    - Content is discovered by links
    - Bots start with a few web pages and then uses the links in the those pages to find other sites
    - To direct bots away from certain pages of your site you can use Robots.txt file (pages with promo codes, or old content) 
    - Crawlers can't access content in protected pages
    - Crawlers can't access pages if there's no link to that page somewhere in the site
  - Indexing
    - See how many pages of your site are indexed by doing `site:yourwbesite.com` and you'll see the pages indexed for that site
    - Sign up for google search console account (you can submit sitemaps and monitor submitted pages being added to the index)
  - Ranking
    - The ordering of search results by relevance

### Robots.txt
- Crawl budget
- Might not want to disallow certain private content because bad actors can use robots.txt to target private content

### Google
- Most SEOs optimize for Google only because good accounts for 90% of all web searches
- Sign up for google search console account
