# Cookies Basics

Cookies
- Stored in the browser
- Sent to the web server they originated from on every request to that web server
- They can be changed directly in the browser (like in dev tools) and will actually be updated
- Node: use package cookie-parser to see cookies
    - app.use(cookieParser()) to load it
    - In a route you can log request.cookies to see them
- Client side: access the cookies for the current url in your tab
    - Use document.cookie
    - *You can disable client side access via javascript add the config option { httpOnly: true } to the cookie. Config object is the 3rd argument
    - Other config
        - When deploying to prod
            - secure: true (makes it only work on https domains)
            - maxAge: milliseconds (browser will automatically delete it)
- Biggest security exploit
    - Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
    - It takes advantage of the fact that cookies are always sent along to a server from the browser whenever a request is made
    - Use package: csurf
    - Using csurf on routes makes a csrfToken available which you can place in the html Dom (the Dom isnâ€™t accessible to attackers) so when the request comes in csurf checks if the csrfToken is available and correct and if not throws an error
- Sessions with cookies
