# Figma Basics

## What's it for?
- Rapid prototyping of websites and apps
- From wireframes to high fidelity mock ups
- Can actually do testing with figma site (rapid prototyping)

## Shortcuts
- Reposition the entire canvas of a design file: hold space bar
- Copy and paste frames (click the name to highlight)
- Zoom in and out: cmd - or cmd +
- Zoom to 100%: shift 0
- Duplicate the thing you just did: cmd d (replicates the last thing you did)
- Move selected element among the layers: cmd [ or cmd ]
- Tools
  - Scale: K
  - Selection: V
  - Slice: S

## Design Files
- Frames
  - Think of them as pages
  - Usually based on a device screen size
  - Design for 1 common phone size (dev will account for various devices)
  - *Might use the same size as the device of your client*

## Frames and Groups
- Groups are group content
- Frames are similar but they survive beyond their elements
  - You can do cool things (like clip content) that you can't do with group
  - You can set constraints on elements within the frame (force elements to stick to certain corners, etc) which is helpful for redoing a view for a different screen size
- *Ungroup works for both frames and groups*

## Text
- Box width: Auto or fixed width
- Font: you can click and slide values
  - Font size you can use arrows to go up and down
  - Go up and down by 10 points when holding shift
  - *NBest to choose font size on your device*
  - Double click a textbox, press option + drag the element to duplicate it

## Shapes
- Rects
  - Create rounded corner by zooming in a using the little dot
  - Resize box evenly on both side hold the option key and drag one side

## Color
- Use eye dropper to drop color
  - Shortcut: select and element and type the letter "i"

## Styling
- Figma main icon ? edit > Set default properties (this will set default settings for specific kinds of elements)
- Copy/paste properties styles (Edit > Copy Properties)

## Images
- Place Image

## Object Editing
- Select element and click the icon at the top or double click element

## Selection
- You can do 2 different things with selection tool
  - Move (meaning not scale properties)
  - Scale which scaled all properties as you're resizing an element
