# UI UX Desing Basics

## What is it?
- UI: The way something looks
- UX: The way it works/how it's used by users
  - Lots of testing

## Persona
- 1 to 2 pages
- An example of a possible user customer type
- It's a type or group of person the website or app is for
- Helps in conversations between developers and designers and clients to speak about a third party about likes/dislikes/needs

## Task flow vs user flow
- ???

## Low-fi vs Hi-fi
- Low Fidelity is a quick wireframe (for task flow)
  - Don't waste time on any styles
  - Pick a boring color and a boring font
- High fidelity is styled
  - *NOT NEEDED FOR TESTING
